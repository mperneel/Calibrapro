Calibration of projection -> Calibrapro
Calibrapro is software to annotate real world coordinates of image points. Based on these annotation, a projection matrix can be determined.
This projection matrix can be used to determine real world coordinates of points based on their corresponding image coordinates, suplemented 
with one of the three real world coordinate values.
